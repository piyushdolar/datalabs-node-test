# Eatlabs(eatlab.ai) Test

### Error Explanation,

### In short:

assert:deepStrictEqual error occurred when, If the two objects are not equal, an assertion failure is being caused, and the program is terminated.

### Detailed:

usePointTrans1() is causing member id 3 to be deduct -5 from initial 20 amount which making member id 3 to place his position into rank premium while code is trying to grouping so in result we're getting only 2 values which cause assertion to be failed.
